# Automobile_Spare_Parts_Sales_Analysis
Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing an automobile spares dataset to derive insights related to sales trends, client preferences, product lines, and warehouse performance. The dataset contains information about order numbers, dates, warehouses, client types, product lines, quantities, unit prices, total sales, payment methods, and payment fees. The analysis aims to answer specific queries related to sales, product pricing, client preferences, and warehouse performance.

Project Structure:
The project is structured into multiple sections, each addressing a specific query or analysis:

1. Data Import and Initial Exploration:

Importing necessary libraries for data handling and visualization.
Loading the dataset into the workspace.
Initial data exploration including checking for null values, duplicate rows, and outliers.
Data Cleansing and Preprocessing:

2. Data cleansing operations to ensure data quality.
Handling potential outliers.
Exploring the dataset characteristics such as date range, warehouse types, client types, product lines, and transaction details.
Analysis and Insights:

3. Analyzing sales based on payment methods.
Investigating average unit prices across different product lines.
Examining average sales and total sales by client types.
Exploring sales performance across different warehouses.
Analyzing total and average sales by product lines.
Investigating the relationship between client types and payment methods.
Exploring quantity frequency distribution by product line.


Key Findings:
1. Payment Methods: Transfer payments are the most preferred method, with sales exceeding cash sales by more than eight times.

2. Product Pricing: Engines are the most expensive product line, while breaking systems are the least expensive. This difference in pricing reflects in the average sales of each product line.

3. Client Preferences: Wholesale clients contribute more to the total sales volume compared to retail clients, although retail clients have a higher average order value.

4. Warehouse Performance: The central warehouse outperforms the west warehouse in terms of overall sales, despite having similar average sales per order.

5. Product Line Sales: Frame & body and suspension & traction are the top-selling product lines based on total sales, followed by electrical system and breaking system.

6. Client-Payment Relationship: Transfer payments are exclusively used for wholesale orders, while credit cards are preferred for retail orders.

7. Quantity Distribution: Most orders consist of fewer than 10 units, with suspension & traction being the highest-selling product line based on quantity.

Conclusion:
The analysis provides valuable insights into sales trends, client preferences, product pricing, and warehouse performance. Understanding these patterns can help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding inventory management, pricing strategies, and client engagement to optimize sales and profitability.
